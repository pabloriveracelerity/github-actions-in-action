# github-actions-in-action

Following the Github Actions tutorial here:

https://hacksoft.blog/github-actions-in-action-setting-up-django-and-postgres/

The code in this repo is not the same as the tutorial.
Some of the parts of the tutorial were outdated.
This version fixes that.

This version does skip the use of postgres for the sake of brevity.
